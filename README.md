Problem Description

Hello, and welcome! Please make sure to read all parts carefully.

This assignment will test your basic knowledge of Branching, Iteration, the Random class, and the Math class.

Solution Description

Your program will consist of 3 files: FloorOrMax.java, SquareRoot.java, and BigOrSmall.java. A description for each class is given below. Please read all the steps and look at the Example Output carefully before you begin.

Overall Notes

‚Ä¢ Every print statement should be followed by a new line character such that every time something is printed it starts on a new line.

‚Ä¢ In order to receive full credit from autograded tests, the random method from the Math class must generate the specified ranges of numbers in the simplest way possible.

FloorOrMax.java

‚Ä¢ Notes: You must use the floor and max methods found in the Math class for this part. Refer to the Java API for information on these two methods. Also, when we say 54.0 is exclusive, we mean that the resulting double should not be able to be 54.0 exactly, but it could be, say, 53.9999.

‚Ä¢ Create a class called FloorOrMax, and inside this class create a main method. Inside the main method do the following:

1. Using the random method found in the Math class, generate a random floating-point number between 4.0 (inclusive) and 54.0 (exclusive) and save it to a variable named myRand.

2. Print out ‚ÄúThe value is: [value]‚Äù rounded to 2 decimal places where [value] is replaced with myRand rounded.

3. If the floor of myRand is even and greater then 15, floor it and print out the result as an integer.

4. If the floor of myRand is odd, print out the maximum between myRand and the number 32.

5. Otherwise, print out myRand as is.

SquareRoot.java

‚Ä¢ Notes: You must use the Random class (which can be imported from java.util.Random) for this part. Refer to the Java API for information on this class.

‚Ä¢ Create a class called SquareRoot, and inside this class create a main method. Inside the main method do the following:

1. Create a Random variable called rand.

2. Using the Random object passed into the method, generate a random whole number between

1_000_000_000_000_000 (15 zeros; inclusive) and 1_000_000_000_000_300 (inclusive) and

save it into a variable named bigRandNum. HINT: Think about what data type is required to store a value of this size.

3. Print out ‚ÄúThe value is: [value]‚Äù where [value] is replaced with bigRandNum.

4. Using a while loop, print out the square root of bigRandNum, and then the square root of that result, and so on successively until the result reaches the value of 1.

5. Determine how many iterations of the while loop were required to reduce this number to 1. After the while loop is done executing, print out ‚ÄúCount: [count]‚Äù (with the actual count replacing the bracketed section).

BigOrSmall.java

‚Ä¢ Create a class called BigOrSmall, and inside this class create a main method. Inside the main method do the following:

1. Using the random method found in the Math class, generate a random whole number between 1 (exclusive) and 5 (inclusive) and save it to a variable named smallRandNum.

2. Print out ‚ÄúWe will run [value] times!‚Äù where [value] is replaced with the value of smallRandNum .

3. Using the generated number, run a for-loop that the smallRandNum number of iterations.

4. In each iteration of the for-loop, use the random method from the Math class to generate a random whole number between 1 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive) and save it to a variable.

5. Print out ‚ÄúThe value is: [value]‚Äù (with the generated number replacing the bracketed section).

6. If that number is greater than 10, print out ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù.

7. Otherwise, print out ‚ÄúNay!‚Äù.

Example Outputs

Example partial output for each of the three files is shown below.

FloorOrMax output:

The value is: 52.73

52

SquareRoot output:

The value is: 1000000000000111

31622776

5623

74

8

2

1

Count: 6

BigOrSmall output:

We will run 2 times! The value is: 10

Nay!

The value is: 11 Yay!

Import Restrictions

Feature Restrictions

There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our autograder. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

‚Ä¢ var (the reserved keyword)

‚Ä¢ System.exit

Collaboration

No collaboration is allowed on this assignment. See syllabus for more details.

Turn-In Procedure

To submit, upload the files listed below to the corresponding assignment on Gradescope:

‚Ä¢ FloorOrMax.java ‚Ä¢ SquareRoot.java

‚Ä¢ BigOrSmall.java

Important Notes (Don‚Äôt Skip)

‚Ä¢ Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items

‚Ä¢ Do not submit .class files

‚Ä¢ Test your code in addition to the basic checks on Gradescope

‚Ä¢ Submit every file each time you resubmit

‚Ä¢ Read the ‚ÄúAllowed Imports‚Äù and ‚ÄúRestricted Features‚Äù to avoid losing points ‚Ä¢ Check on Piazza for all official clarifications
